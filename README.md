# ML-Forge
Welcome to ML-Forge, a dynamic repository that serves as a testament to the exploration and experimentation with a multitude of Machine Learning models across varied datasets.
This repository is a showcase of my joruney through ML, where I experiment with different algorithms to tackle unique problems in classification, clustering and regression.

## Project Highlights
ML-Forge is divided into several projects, each focused on a specific dataset and set of ML models. Below is an overview of the projects contained within thsi repository.


### Particle Classification - "Magic"
**Objective:** Classify particles as either Alpha or Gamma based on input features.

**Datasets:** A dataset containing a table of information on Alpha and Gamma particles.

**Implemented Models:**
..* K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
..* Naive Bayes
..* Logistic Regression
..* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
..* Neural Networks


### Seed Clustering
**Objective:** Cluster seeds into their specific types based on their features.

**Datasets:** A dataset with information regarding various seeds and their respective classes.

**Implemented Models:**
..* K-Means Clustering
..* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by K-Means Clustering

### Bike Rental Prediction - Seoul
**Objective:** Predict the number of bikes rented out in Seoul based on weather and other input features.

**Dataset:** Information regarding the number of bikes rent out in Seoul at different times of the day, and how they are influenced by weather conditions.

**Implemented Models:**
..* Multiple Linear Regression
..* Regression with Neural Networks

## Prerequisites
